Welcome to my first post on computer vision! I'm writing this for
several reasons:

* Computer vision is cool
* There are hardly any good resources for learning computer
  vision, especially classical computer vision - neural networks
  are cool but they aren't always the best solution
* I graduated from an (FRC)[https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc]
  team this year and since I need to teach the younger students anyway,
  there's no reason not to share my lessons with the world

So first of all, what's computer vision good for? Here's a simple game
to see.
